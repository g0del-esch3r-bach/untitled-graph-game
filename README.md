This repository is *similar* to conj1349-graph-env.

However, it does not use Gym(nasium) from the start. This time we build the code from the ground up.
We follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoGRjPt-vms (for the most part) and use Gym(nasium) only when necessary. (Update: turns out "only when necessary" is, like, 98% of the time.)
